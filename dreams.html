    <center><p>
      I don't wish to have a wealthy life but to have a good life, that's all I wanted.<br>
      I want to experience everything I wanted without considering the money, I want to study in a school<br>
      where they will guide me to be professional in my chosen career. I want to live in a cozy house, full fridge and so...<br>
      I want to travel around the world where I can leave all my worries and refrsh my mind in everything that's been happening.</p></center>

    <h1><i>Basic Information about Myself</i></h1>

<p> <i>
  Hello! I am Mariel G. Mosico, 19 years old from Tanza, Cavite. 
  I am currently studying at Cavite State University as a first year college student taking up Bachelor Science in Information Technology. 
  If you will ask me if why did I pursue this course simply because I want to learn how technologies really works. I will lie to you if i say that 
  this course is easy because it's really difficult, sometimes I just want stop because I can feel that I don't excel in this field. 
  Yes, I learned but it seems like my learning is not enough because everytime I'm solving problems especially codes I always get it wrong.
